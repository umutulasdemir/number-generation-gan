# Number Generation GAN Project

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model using the PyTorch library. The model is capable of generating new numbers resembling the distribution of a given dataset.

## Usage

Ensure Python and the PyTorch library are installed.

## Model Structure

The model consists of two main components: a generator and a discriminator network.

- The generator network takes random input vectors and attempts to transform them into realistic-looking images.
- The discriminator network distinguishes between real images from the dataset and images generated by the generator.

These two networks are trained simultaneously in a competitive manner. The generator learns to produce more realistic images, while the discriminator learns to better distinguish between real and generated images.

## Dataset

For this project, the MNIST dataset is used. However, you can replace it with any other dataset of your choice.
